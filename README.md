# 🛡️ RiskyURL – Web Security Analysis Tool

## 📌 Overview

**RiskyURL** is a cybersecurity-focused project designed to help **developers and security learners identify common web application security issues** caused by insecure coding practices or misconfigurations.

It performs automated checks for frequently exploited vulnerabilities, allowing developers to detect and fix issues early in the development lifecycle.

## 📂 How It Works

RiskyURL analyzes a target URL by sending controlled test payloads and inspecting responses to identify potential security weaknesses.  
The results are compiled into a **structured security report** that can be downloaded for further review or documentation.

---

## 📄 Report Generation

After the scan completes, RiskyURL allows users to **download a detailed report** containing:
- Identified vulnerabilities
- Affected endpoints
- Severity indicators
- Security recommendations

This report can be used for **debugging, audits, or security improvement tracking**.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- Help developers catch **basic security mistakes**
- Improve secure coding awareness
- Demonstrate real-world web vulnerability patterns
- Serve as an educational cybersecurity PoC
